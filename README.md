## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

After creating countless VM's in Oracle VirtualBox manually, I decided it was time to save myself some cycles and work more efficiently. This is my process and the .sh file I used to execute after the preliminary configurations.

## Installation

Install latest version of Oracle VirtualBox

#Requirements  

Create a new VM  
Configurations:  
Settings  -> Network  
Add two network cards 
NatNetwork 
Host only 
network card  

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

This was done entirely on open source software. No licenses were necessary to create a fresh instance.
